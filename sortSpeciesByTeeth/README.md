# sortSpeciesByTeeth
Function that sorts an array of key value pairs based on the value of one of the objects

1. Write a function sortSpeciesByTeeth() that takes in an array of species objects in the format:

{speciesName: 'shark', numTeeth: 50 }
and sorts the array in ascending order based on the average number of teeth that species possesses (numTeeth) .

You’ll need to access each object’s .numTeeth property. Feel free to either write a named comparison function, or use an anonymous function for your argument to .sort().
